##Details

Here's what this script does for you / adds to the GitHub website.

###Commit Ref Links

When viewing a PR, there is a short summary text similar to this at the top:

- **user2** wants to merge 8 commits into `user1:master` from `user2:branch`

The `user1:master` and `user2:branch` placeholders are now links to the respective branches.

(this applies to all `user:branch` placeholders wherever they appear)

###Toggleable File Diffs

When viewing the changed files of a PR, you can now collapse and expand the files by clicking the individual file headers.
Alternatively, you can collapse and expand all at the same time by clicking one of the new buttons at the top.
